# ESP32-Touch-Sensor-Controlled-LED-Interactive-Touch-Based-Light-Switching
This ESP32 project controls an LED using a built-in capacitive touch sensor on GPIO 4. When touched, the sensor detects low values and turns the LED (GPIO 23) ON. When untouched, the LED turns OFF. Itâ€™s a simple example of using touchRead() for touch-based interaction.
